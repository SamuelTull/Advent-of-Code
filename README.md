Raw, unmodified advent of code solutions

In some cases I tried an improved solution that I have seen on reddit/youtube 

2022 was the first year where I completed each day on release, other years have some solutions from the time and some that I have completed in 2022/23 

As of 2023, X.py will print solution to P1 then solution to P1, in previous years these are in separate files.
